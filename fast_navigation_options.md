# Fast Directory Navigation Approaches

Here's a brief summary of modern approaches for quickly navigating directories in the shell, designed to be powerful without interfering with shell hooks like `nvm`.

### 1. `zoxide` (Recommended)

- **Concept**: A "smarter `cd`". It learns your most frequently used directories.
- **Usage**: Replace `cd` with `z`. After a brief learning period, you can jump to directories with minimal typing (e.g., `z api` jumps to your main API project).
- **Pros**: Highly efficient, requires no manual alias configuration, and integrates safely with shell features.
- **Cons**: Requires installing a new tool (via Homebrew) and learning the `z` command.

### 2. `fzf` (Fuzzy Finder)

- **Concept**: An interactive menu for directory navigation.
- **Usage**: Use a hotkey (e.g., `ALT+C`) to open a fuzzy-searchable list of all your directories. Type a few letters to filter, then press Enter to `cd`.
- **Pros**: Very powerful, interactive, and can be used for much more than just directory navigation (files, history, etc.). Does not override `cd`.
- **Cons**: Requires installing `fzf` and is interactive, which can be slower than a direct command.

### 3. Curated Alias Command (Safer version of the current method)

- **Concept**: Keep the `@alias` syntax, but move it to a dedicated command instead of overriding `cd`.
- **Usage**: Create a new command like `go` or `j`. Use it like `go @monorepo/api`. Standard `cd` remains for all other uses.
- **Pros**: Keeps the exact `@alias` syntax, requires no new tools, and is guaranteed not to conflict with `nvm`.
- **Cons**: Requires changing the muscle memory from `cd @...` to `go @...` and manual maintenance of the alias list.
